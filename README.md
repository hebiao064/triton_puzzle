# Triton Puzzles Solutions  

This repository contains solutions to the [Triton Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles) repository. The puzzles are designed to help users gain hands-on experience with **Triton**, a high-performance GPU programming framework.  

## Overview  

Each solution implements a custom Triton kernel to solve a specific computational problem efficiently. The implementations follow best practices in GPU programming, ensuring **optimal memory access patterns**, **parallel execution**, and **vectorized operations** where applicable.
